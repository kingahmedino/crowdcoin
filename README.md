<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]()

Crowdcoin is a crowdfunding platform that allows you to get funding easily using crypto. Crowdcoin is different from other crowdfunding sites because it's decentralized, meaning that there's no central authority or bank account keeping track of funds. This means that you don't have to pay fees or wait for your money to be transferred across the world. Crowdcoin is also more secure than other platforms because it uses smart contracts and blockchain technology.
